<h2>The Orkhon Inscriptions</h2>

<h4>A Glimpse into Ancient Turkic History</h4>

<p>
The Orkhon Inscriptions, also known as the Orkhon Script or Orkhon-Yenisey Script, are a collection of ancient inscriptions that provide valuable insights into the history and culture of the <a href="/en/turkic-people/">Turkic peoples</a>. These inscriptions, dating back to the 8th century, were discovered in the Orkhon Valley, along the Orhkon river of Mongolia and have played a significant role in unraveling the mysteries of early Turkic civilizations.
</p>

<h4>Historical Significance</h4>

<p>
The Orkhon Inscriptions are considered one of the most important sources of information about the early Turkic peoples, shedding light on their language, social structures, and historical events. Inscribed on stone monuments known as "stele", these writings were erected by the G√∂k-T√ºrks, a powerful Turkic Khaganate that dominated Central Asia during the 6th to 8th centuries.
</p>

<h4>Content and Script</h4>

<p>
The inscriptions are primarily written in the Turkic language using the <a href=/en/old-turkic-alphabet/>Old Turkic Alphabet</a>, which is an ancient Turkic runic alphabet. The script consists of angular and straight lines, arranged in vertical columns from top to bottom and read from right to left. The inscriptions cover a wide range of topics, including genealogy, political achievements, religious beliefs, and heroic epics of Turkic peoples.
